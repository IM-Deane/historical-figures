# Project: Memories Social Media App

_Current Version:_ 1.0.0

# Description: This app utilizes the MERN stack to create a small-scale social media application.

Users can create an account or login using their google account. Once they've
chosen an account option, the user can create a post that is saved in a MongoDB
Atlas cluster.

Only users who're signed in can like the posts and only the post's creator can
edit/delete the post.

# Version History:

_Version 1.0.0:_

This version of the project builds upon a previous app that had basic CRUD
functionality. In this update, the app now has an authorization feature that
only allows users with an account to interact with the posts.
